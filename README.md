Mobility and Geospatial Data for Health Solutions in Africa

The initiative is an inclusive and Pan-African hands-on training and learning hackathon focused on solving specific local problems and driving data-driven decision-making in health service optimization applications using mobility and geospatial data. The event is aimed at building an ecosystem for local talent development and the application of Artificial Intelligence in health in 4 African countries: Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa.

- To drive real-world application that solves specific health problems whilst finding an intersection between theory and practice.
- Democratize spatial knowledge through learnings and hackathons.
- Enable young researchers in Africa on how to use mobility data to solve problems.
- Increase employability of young Africans through hands-on exposure to geospatial analysis in a real-world capacity.
- Enhancing quality of machine learning skill set available in the country while deepening local content agenda.
